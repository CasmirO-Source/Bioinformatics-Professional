#  Multiomics Data Simulation and Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a pipeline for simulating, processing, and visualising multiomics datasets (transcriptomics and metabolomics). It is designed as part of a bioinformatics learning portfolio, demonstrating core concepts in data simulation, preprocessing, integration, and visualisation.

This project reflects my interest in biological data analysis and serves as preparation for postgraduate study in Bioinformatics.

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate understanding of multiomics data structures (genes + metabolites)
- Practice data cleaning and feature selection methods
- Apply simple statistical strategies to visualize sample-level variation
- Create reproducible, structured Python code suitable for academic or industry settings

---

##  Overview

The pipeline simulates synthetic omics data to mimic real-world conditions (including missing values), then processes and visualizes the data to identify patterns across samples.

It includes two main Python scripts:

1. 'generated_data.py' – simulates and exports fake transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets
2. 'analysis.py' – loads, cleans, combines, and visualizes the data using basic statistical methods
